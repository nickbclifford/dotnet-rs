# Plans

The project goal is a maintainable ECMA-335 runtime whose supported behavior and safety
boundaries are understandable. Prefer one working runtime path over more infrastructure,
audits or documents.

## Queue

In priority order. Each plan's own `Status:` line is the only record of its status.

| ID | Plan | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | [Stable homes for addressable locals and arguments](01-stable-frame-homes.md) | Next |
| 02 | [Native continuations](02-native-continuations.md) | Parked until a specific operation is chosen |
| 03 | [Executor teardown ownership](03-executor-teardown-ownership.md) | Done; kept as a pointer to the contract |

## Not yet planned

Known problems without a plan. Write a plan for one only when it is chosen as the next work.
Evidence and IDs (p01…, R01…) are defined in the
[pointer-provenance inventory](../pointer-provenance/INVENTORY.md).

- **Negative and wide managed-pointer offsets:** `ManagedPtr` stores a compact unsigned offset,
  so byref arithmetic that goes below the base or past the compact range (for example
  `Unsafe.Subtract`, or `Unsafe.Add` with a negative count) fails with `NotImplemented`
  (`managed_offset_error` in `crates/dotnet-value/src/stack_value.rs`).
- **Static field addresses:** `ldsflda; conv.u` writes and static payload alignment
  (`p12_ldsflda_convu_stind_static`).
- **Native call boundary:** payload addresses, ABI returns, by-ref/out copy-back and pinned
  lifetime for P/Invoke (R06/R07). The current cross-arena raw-escape and by-value
  managed-pointer aggregate rejections stay until this is done.
- **Shared raw-memory access:** one protocol for competing plain, volatile, atomic, block and
  raw-alias accesses to shared storage (heap, statics) under `multithreading` (R09/R12).
- **Resumable bulk operations and barriers:** `cpblk`/`initblk`/`Memmove`/`Array.Copy`/`Fill`
  that keep progress across safepoints and apply GC write barriers to reference slots (R10/R11).
- **Cross-arena collection fixture:** the real-VM collection test builds a foreign-branded
  `Gc`; replace it with a validly branded fixture (remainder of R08).
- **CI feedback:** remaining steps of the [test hierarchy](../CI.md#test-hierarchy-and-migration).

## Writing a plan

A plan is a short, current document an agent can act on. Keep history in git and evidence in
`docs/pointer-provenance/` or `docs/ci-evidence/`.

- **Header:** `Status:` (Not started / In progress / Parked / Complete) and a one-sentence
  **Outcome** that a test can check.
- **Problem:** what goes wrong today, with code paths and test names.
- **Scope:** what is in, and what is out with the reason. Use the spec (ECMA-335 section
  numbers) to rule out cases that valid programs cannot produce.
- **Design:** the chosen approach, briefly. Reuse existing mechanisms where one fits.
- **Slices:** ordered increments. Each slice ends with the VM using the new path and its tests
  enabled. A slice never builds support that only a later slice uses.
- **Done when:** the checkable exit conditions.
- **Ask the maintainer only if:** a short list of specific triggers.

If a slice turns out to need much more than its description (new modules, or support for
cases outside the stated scope), stop and revise the plan rather than splitting the work into
more preparatory steps.
