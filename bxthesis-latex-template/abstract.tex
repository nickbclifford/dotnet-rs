Rust is a modern systems programming language designed for robust memory safety, performance, and developer productivity.
By contrast, most large-scale or enterprise-grade programming languages are implemented in advanced memory-unsafe C++.
We explore the potential benefits of using Rust for such complex runtimes by implementing a bytecode interpreter
for the .NET Common Language Runtime.
