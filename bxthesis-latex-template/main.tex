You might consider thanking the people you may need to thank: advisor, reader, classmates, friends, family. This is entirely optional, but encouraged. If your thesis was part of a project where you worked with other people, this section should include a citation to the full work and should also clearly outline your own contributions. Keep in mind that the words in your thesis document should be your own, not those of your co-authors.
